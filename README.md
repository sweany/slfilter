# slfilter

slfilter is a Perl/Tk program which monitors for syslog messages, and displays messages which match a desired filter string. This program's practical use may be marginal, but it has been a great way to learn about Perl/Tk.

## Features

* Listen on 514/udp for syslog messages, or sniff the wire (future)
* Highlight messages based on priority and/or message contents
* Filter messages using multiple inclusion or exclusion
* Save/Export log entries (future)
